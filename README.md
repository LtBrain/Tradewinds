# TRADEWINDS

Tradewinds is a trading game based on the historically sea-faring Ancient Greeks. This is a fully CLI based game utilizing Node.js and Clack.js.

This game is still in alpha, so there are many unrefined aspects of it.

As nexe and SEA seem not to work on this project, you will have to have Node.JS runtime installed for this game to run. Node.JS v20.18.0 or higher is recommended, and the installation of Clack.JS and Chalk are required. 

> cd Tradewinds
> 
> node main.js
